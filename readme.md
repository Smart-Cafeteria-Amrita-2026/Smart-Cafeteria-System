## L5 — Smart Cafeteria Demand Forecasting & Token-Based Queue Optimization

The Smart Cafeteria System is an intelligent campus dining management platform designed to optimize food preparation, reduce congestion, and enhance the overall student dining experience. Moving beyond traditional food ordering systems, this platform integrates meal slot pre-booking, demand forecasting, and a digital token-based queue to ensure efficiency, fairness, and sustainability.

## Key Features

### Meal Slot Pre-Booking
Enables students to reserve dining slots in advance, helping control crowd density and minimize long waiting times.

### Demand Forecasting
Uses historical consumption data, academic schedules, and external factors such as weather conditions to accurately predict meal demand, assisting kitchen staff in optimal food preparation.

### Digital Token-Based Queue System
Ensures fair and organized food serving while reducing physical queues and confusion during peak hours.

### Real-Time Occupancy Dashboard
Provides live visibility into cafeteria congestion levels, allowing staff to monitor crowd flow and make informed operational decisions.

### Waste Reduction & Sustainability
Focuses on minimizing food waste through accurate forecasting and responsible resource utilization.

## Ethics & Sustainability

The system is built on ethical and sustainable principles, emphasizing:

  - Transparent resource allocation

  - Reduced food discard

  - Fair access to cafeteria services

  - Environmentally responsible operations

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to balance efficient resource utilization with an improved student experience, creating a cafeteria environment that is:

  - Fair

  - Efficient

  - Scalable

  - Environmentally conscious

By integrating smart forecasting and queue optimization, the Smart Cafeteria System promotes a more equitable and sustainable campus dining ecosystem.
